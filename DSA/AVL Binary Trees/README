AVL tree - self balancing tree. Heights of 2 children differ by at most 1.

delete() has bugs
If you insert 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 25 and then delete 50, 40, 10, no rebalance happens after deleting 40 even though tree is unbalanced.
Likely because height is not being updated in the right places in the delete() function.
